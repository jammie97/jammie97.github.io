							<p>I'd like to start by saying a few things.
							</p>
							<p><ul>
									<li>
										I'd like to say thank you to a couple of people who helped me with this project. 
										Firstly Dan Hodgson, who supervised the project from the start to the end.
										 And also Chris Rook, for giving guidance and also acting as second marker for
										this dissertation.
									</li>
									<li>This project is covered by an NDA (None Disclosure Agreement) with Sony therefor 
										it cannot be released to the public, however I am hoping to create a public 
										version which removes any implementation of PSSL and the PlayStation 4's 
										and instead replace it with GLSL (OpenGL's Shader Language).</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<p>
								Towards the end of my Computer Games Programming degree, I was required to create 
								an individual project. For this project I created an environment in 
								which graphical shaders were created for the PlayStation 4 without the 
								required skill set to write PSSL (PlayStation Shader Language) scripts.
							</p>
							<p>
								To start with, research went into various different shader environments found online. 
								Due to the PSSL language being covered by an NDA, no environments were found online 
								which created PSSL shaders, however there were quite a few which used GLSL.
							</p>
							<p>
								Next, the interface was made, which was done using WPF and C#. Two iterations of 
								this design was done, due to the first design not being to my own liking. 
								The second design created was then compared with the first design using a 
								survey to tell which design would be the preferred one, and the second 
								was preferred greatly.
							</p>
							<p>
								After this, OpenGL was implemented into the program as previewing PSSL is 
								not possible on other platforms other than a PlayStation 4 and it 
								was decided that the shaders which were previewed would be in GLSL 
								and then exported into PSSL.
							</p>
							<p>
								Once the view port was set up and models could be imported for previewing, 
								shader editing was then implemented using two main settings types on the left 
								of the program. The two types of settings were 'Basic' and 'Advanced'.
								<ul>
									<li>
										'Basic' settings gives options such as adding ripple effects, 
										giving a toon shader, changing basic lighting colour.
									</li>
									<li>
										'Advanced' settings gives the option of writing in GLSL 
										straight into the editor with an error log implemented on the bottom 
										if there is any problems within the written code.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="pssl-environment.png" alt="Shader Environment" /></span>
								Once this was all done, a text box and two buttons was then added to 
								the top to give the shader created a name and to then export the 
								shader in either GLSL or PSSL. The reason to adding a button for 
								GLSL despite the application being aimed at PSSL was due to the 
								application already previewing in GLSL therefor it made sense to 
								just export that generated code also. The PSSL button however 
								converts the GLSL code into a format readable by the PlayStation 4 
								and any projects which have the functionality to load in PSSL shader files.
							</p>
							<p>
								Overall I thought this project was a huge success, as shaders exported were 
								able to be used within the PlayStation 4 and using 
								user feedback through a survey, the application 
								itself looked to a professional standard. This 
								program is something I'd hopefully like to come 
								back to once I am able to use the PlayStation 4's once 
								again may it be through university through my masters or 
								through other means as I feel this program with a bit more work 
								could be used within a real life scenario to easily create 
								PlayStation 4 shaders to be used within games currently being 
								developed on the PlayStation 4.
