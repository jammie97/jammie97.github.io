							<p>With the PlayStation 4 having its own shader language to explore, 
								the idea of having advanced visuals through various means with shader 
								scripting was possible on the PlayStation 4.
							</p>
							<p>Work within PSSL had already been done whilst creating a basic 3D game on the PlayStation 4 
								had already been done but at a basic level. This basic level included having 
								vertex shader and pixel shader which essentially placed the object on screen with 
								either a solid colour or texture and having some basic lighting. For this 3D game 
								this was all that was needed as the game wasn't planned to be that complex, 
								however I knew other things were most definitely possible through shaders 
								to create even better visuals with the vertex and pixel shader.
							</p>
							<p>Normal mapping was first trialled within the pixel shader. Normal mapping uses a 
								texture which consists of mainly red, green and blue colours 
								(which will be explained why soon). The normal map texture essentially 
								explains to the program how you would like light to be bounced off the object 
								in order to create a form of inconsistency to the surface. This could make a 
								cube reflect like it is made out of mud, or metal, or any other material. 
								However when game modellers create assets for a game, they can make a normal 
								map for the object in order to save polygons but still have a detailed model. 
								An example of this could be a human face in which there is a reasonable amount 
								of polygons on the model whilst making the normal map show the the little wrinkles 
								and dimples of a face by making the light bounce off the skin slightly. The main 
								use of normal mapping essentially is to make a model look complex whilst saving 
								on polygons.
							</p>

							<p>
									Once this was explored with PSSL, I went further by including a height map 
									in combination to the normal map. As shown on the right, a normal map adds 
									detail to a model without the use of extra polygons by 
									changing how light reflects on the surface. 
									A height map is used with the vertex 
									shader to make vertices move depending on a black and white texture; 
									if you were to imagine the texture placed on the model the same way 
									a texture is placed on a model, wherever there would be white, the 
									vertex is raised and vise versa with the black.
							</p>
							<p>
									Another thing which was explored within PSSL, was its own compute shader. 
									The compute shader can be used for a variety of things and focuses on doing 
									the calculations on different separate threads on the PlayStation 4's GPU; 
									multi tasking can be done on such a high scale. So using the compute 
									shader and placing around a high number ofÂ  objects on screen (+1000), 
									I were able to do a flocking algorithm where all objects using the 
									algorithm had to check where all the other objects were to see if the 
									current object running the script had to do anything different in its 
									movement in order to flock appropriately. Due to using the compute 
									shader, all objects on screen managed to flock whilst having a high 
									frame rate on the PlayStation 4 showing that the program wasn't 
									struggling to keep up with the flock algorithm.
							</p>
							<p>
									Working with the PSSL library has 
									been such an amazing experience which 
									few programmers are given the chance to freely 
									play around with the hardware Sony has to 
									offer in the PlayStation 4s.
