							<p>
								For an assignment during my degree in Computer Games Programming, 
								I was tasked with making a game in which I had to write the AI for 
								a team of bots to beat another team of bots with badly written AI. 
								This was all done in C++ and within a 2D game engine created by the 
								module tutor Chris Rook.
							</p>
							<p>
								The game was essentially a 5 v 5 between two teams fighting over domination 
								points. There is no end to the game, just two scores which explain 
								which team had the better AI. Everything was already created before 
								starting the AI such as the map, where the domination points were, 
								the teams and the various rules which needed to be followed. All 
								there was left to do was write a AI which could beat the enemies 
								teams premade AI.
							</p>
							<p>
								The AI was split into two different sections; the generation of a 
								navmesh in which the bots could use the navmesh to work out 
								how to get from point A to point B, and then the making of the bots core 
								AI which told the bot when to find a domination point, when to 
								retreat and get ammo, and when to attack.
							</p>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="navmesh-creation.png" alt="Navmesh Creation" /></span>
								To start with, since the map was premade by Chris, all 
								there was to do was to generate a navmesh. The navmesh was 
								made by passing a rectangle into a function which partitions 
								the rectangle into 4 smaller rectangles if the original rectangle 
								is overlapping an obstacle. If the rectangle either doesnâ€™t 
								overlap and obstacle or gets too small, a node is placed and 
								saved into a list of nodes.
							</p>
							<p>
								Then once all the nodes are placed, edges are created between nodes 
								which can see each other in which paths are made which can reach each other. 
								By doing this, a network of paths is then created and the bots 
								finally have a navmesh which can be traversed. This navmesh 
								can then be used within the A* path-finding algorithm later.
								<span class="image right"><img src="navmesh.jpg" alt="Navmesh" /></span>
							</p>
							<p>
								The second part of the bots AI was then started once the map had been made, 
								and that began with behaviours. These behaviours were actions which the 
								bots could do; seek, flee, arrive, evade, pursue, path find and wall evade. 
								The first five were more advanced and were turned on in specific moments 
								during the path find behaviour (when following points in a path, 
								the bot would seek the next node, when arriving at the last point 
								in a path, it would use the arrive behaviour). The wall avoid 
								behaviour was essentially turned on at all times to make sure a 
								bot would not get stuck on a wall.
							</p>
							<p>
								The most advanced behaviour of these would be the path finding behaviour, 
								in which a path is followed using the seek and arrive behaviours. 
								However for this to work, a path must be found first. Using the navmesh 
								which was made before, an A* algorithm is used to find the shortest 
								path from A to B given two coordinates.
							</p>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="pathfinding.jpg" alt="Navmesh" /></span>
								After this, a function was made which combined all of the 
								different behaviours to make one acceleration vector which 
								the bot used given whichever behaviour is being used at that 
								current time. An easy explanation of this would be that the bot 
								is heading towards a goal, but a wall is in the way. So the 
								acceleration of the seek is added to the acceleration of the 
								wall avoid. In doing so, the bot would still head towards the 
								goal, even if the bot had to slightly turn away from a wall to 
								avoid hitting it.
							</p>
							<p>
								Next to make use of these behaviours, different states was made. 
								A state within the program would in the end give a bot a specific task. 
								In this case, three states was made; capture in which a bot 
								will go and find a domination point and capture it, attack in 
								which an enemy is close and the bot will fight the enemy, and 
								reload in which a bot will go find a reload point and restock 
								on ammo. With this done, the bots were complete and could win 
								in a game. However more could be done to improve the program.
							</p>
							<p>
								Multi-Threading is the idea that a task within a program or 
								application would run a process off the main thread the program 
								runs on an multitasks calculations. This is massively useful in 
								terms of making sure a program is still responsive whilst 
								working out a huge problem or loading a big file (no one wants 
								a program which freezes and becomes unresponsive for a few 
								seconds as it is unprofessional).
							</p>
							<p>
								This was implemented into the program after finding out that the 
								program would stutter whenever a bot needed to do some path finding. 
								With the A* algorithm looping through hundreds of nodes within the 
								game, it can take a lot of processing power and freeze the game slightly. 
								This was proven by recording the update times, and the first update 
								in the game finding 5 different paths in one update cycle 
								(due to having 5 bots per team) was found to be quite large compared 
								to an average frame. Therefore, it was made so whenever a path 
								was to be worked out with the A* algorithm, it would be done on 
								a separate thread and the bot would wait until the path was then 
								found.  This fixed any stutters within the program, and especially 
								within the start of the game. The first frame then returned back 
								to an average frame time and any stutters were completely eliminated. 
								Adding more bots to each team even showed that it had fixed the 
								problem as even with 100 bots finding a path, no pauses or 
								stutters was shown as it were previously even with just 5 bots.
							</p>
							<p>
								The other improvement made within the game was the use of networking. 
								Despite the game only being two teams of bots and not 
								two human players, it was still done. The game was made so that 
								one computer running the game could act as the host, and another 
								computer running the game could act as the client and connect 
								to the host. The host would then send over all the bots position 
								data, ammo and when the bot was shooting so then everything 
								which happened on the host computer would occur on the client 
								computer. This was all done through bit packing showed how a 
								client on any game could spectate another game with just 
								basic information.
							</p>
							<p>
								After the two improvements was done, the game was then finished 
								complete with a working AI which used A* path finding and 
								states, multi-threading and networking. As a year long 
								project, a lot was learnt in undertaking this project 
								including how A*, multi threading and networking all work.
